            <h2>AngularJS Development</h2>
            <p>AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is designed to make it easy to build dynamic, complex web applications with a modular architecture and reusable components. AngularJS allows developers to create single-page applications (SPAs) and provides a framework for building client-side web applications.
