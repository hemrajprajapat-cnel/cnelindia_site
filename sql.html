            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in
              relational databases. It is used to insert, update, retrieve, and delete data in a database. SQL is a
              standard language used by many relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, Oracle,
              Microsoft SQL Server, and others. CnEL developers are expert at SQL and can help you with complex queries.
