            <h2>Drupal Development</h2>
            <p>Drupal is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) that is written in the PHP programming
              language. It is used to create and manage websites, as well as web applications. Drupal like CnEL is known
              for its flexibility and scalability. CnEL can help you utilize Drupal to create large, complex websites
              and web applications. It allows users to easily create and organize content, manage users and permissions,
              and extend the functionality of the website with add-on modules. Drupal also has a strong developer
              community and a vast library of modules that can be used to add additional functionality, such as
              e-commerce, social media integration, and more. Due to its flexibility, scalability, and active developer
              community, Drupal is often used by large organizations, government agencies, and universities.
