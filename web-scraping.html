            <h2>Web Scraping</h2>
            <p>Web scraping, also known as web data extraction or web harvesting, is the process of automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites and saving it for later analysis. This data can include text, images, videos, and other types of content. Web scraping is typically performed using specialized software, such as web crawlers or web scraping bots, which are designed to navigate through websites and extract the desired data.
