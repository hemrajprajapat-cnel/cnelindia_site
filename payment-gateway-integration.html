              <h2>Payment Gateway Integration</h2>

              <p>
                A payment gateway is a service that processes credit card and
                electronic check transactions for online and traditional
                brick-and-mortar businesses. It acts as an intermediary between
                a merchant's website and the financial institution that handles
                the transaction. Payment gateway integration is the process of
                connecting a merchant's website or application to a payment
                gateway, so that customers can securely make payments.

                  Why do you need Payment
                    Gateway Integration services?
                </h2>

                <div class="entry-content">
                  <p>
                    Payment gateway integration requires implementing the
                    gateway's API (Application Programming Interface) into the
                    merchant's website or application, which allows the website
                    or application to communicate with the gateway to process
                    transactions. Payment gateway integration can also include
                    additional features such as fraud detection and prevention,
                    recurring billing, and the ability to issue refunds or void
                    transactions.

                  </p>


                  <p>

                    <b>3. Compliance: </b> Payment gateway integration services

                    information.
