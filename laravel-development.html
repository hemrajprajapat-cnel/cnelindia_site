                    <b>First lets understand why Laravel is so popular</b>
                  <br></br>
                    <b>Some of the key features of Laravel include:</b>
                  <br></br>
                    <b>1. MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:</b> Laravel follows the MVC pattern, which separates the
                  application's logic from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and scale.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>2. Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):</b> Laravel's Eloquent ORM allows developers to work with
                  databases using an object-oriented syntax, making it easier to interact with databases and perform
                  common tasks such as querying and inserting data.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>3. Artisan command-line interface:</b> Laravel includes an integrated command-line interface, Artisan, which provides a set of useful commands for common tasks such as generating code, running migrations, and
                  scheduling tasks.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>4. Blade templating engine:</b> Laravel uses the Blade templating engine, which provides a simple and
                  powerful syntax for creating and managing views.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>5. Queue management:</b> Laravel has built-in support for queue management, allowing developers to easily
                  add tasks to a queue and process them asynchronously, improving application performance.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>6. Advanced routing:</b> Laravel has advanced routing capabilities, which allows developers to easily
                  define and handle different routes, and handle errors and exceptions.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>7. Built-in security features:</b> Laravel includes built-in security features, such as cross-site
                  scripting (XSS) and SQL injection filtering, to help protect your web applications from common security threats.
                  <br></br>
                    <b>8. Community support:</b> Laravel has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its
                  development and provide support to users.
                  <br></br>
                  Overall, Laravel development is a powerful and flexible way to create web applications using PHP,
                  providing a set of tools and resources that enable developers to build robust, scalable, and
                  maintainable web applications quickly and efficiently.
