              <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>

              <p>
                A shopping cart is a software application that allows online
                shoppers to select and temporarily store items in an online
                store, with the intention of later purchasing them. It is also
                known as an e-cart, it functions as a virtual shopping basket
                and helps customers keep track of the items they wish to
                purchase. Once the customer is ready to purchase the items, they
                can proceed to the checkout, where they will be prompted to
                provide shipping and billing information and complete the
                transaction.
