            <h2>Database Management</h2>
            <p> A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, so that it can be easily
              accessed, managed, and updated. It is a structured set of data that can be stored electronically and can
              be used to store a wide variety of information, such as text, numbers, images, and more. Databases can be
              used to store and manage large amounts of data, and they provide a way to access that data quickly and
              efficiently. CnEL can help connect your database to a wide range of applications, such as financial
              records, customer information, inventory management, and more. </p>

                Types of database services offered by CnEL.

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  There are many types of databases, however the most common are:
                  <br><br>
                  <b>1. Relational databases: </b> Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between
                  the tables are established through keys.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>2. NoSQL databases: </b> Data is not organized into tables, and the relationships between the data are not
                  established through keys. Instead, NoSQL databases use a more flexible structure, like document,
                  key-value, graph and column-family.
                  <br><br>
                  Databases are usually managed by a database management system (DBMS), which is a software program that
                  allows users to interact with the database, such as adding, modifying, and retrieving data. Some
                  examples of popular DBMSs are MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra, and PostgreSQL.
