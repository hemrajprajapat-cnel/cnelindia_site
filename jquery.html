            <h2>Jquery</h2>
            <p>jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that makes it easy to add interactive elements, create animations, and handle events on a website. It simplifies many common tasks that are difficult to accomplish with vanilla JavaScript, such as making AJAX requests, traversing and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), and creating complex animations. jQuery also has a wide range of plugins and extensions that can be easily integrated into a website, providing additional functionality and saving development time.
