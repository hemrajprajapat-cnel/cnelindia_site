                    There are several reasons why a business may need web app

                    <br><br>
                    <b>1.Business Efficiency:</b> Web apps can automate
                    repetitive tasks, streamline processes, and improve
                    communication and collaboration within a business, which can
                    help to increase efficiency and productivity.


                    <br><br>
