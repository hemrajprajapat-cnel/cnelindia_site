              <h2>Custom Software Development</h2>
              <p>Custom software development is the process of creating software
                that is tailored to the specific needs and requirements of a
                business or organization. Unlike off-the-shelf software that is
                designed to be used by a wide range of users, custom software is
                designed to be used by a specific organization or group of
                users.
